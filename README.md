* Service-oriented archetecture that runs across network domains, untrusted environments, but securely
* Fully containerized
* Open-source, distributed, plus a centrally-hosted option (Galaxy/UseGalaxy model)
* Metadata abstractions support all varieties of communicable disease (bacteria/archaea, virii, prions, etc)
* Abstractions support genomic and metagenomic epidemiology
* Integration with instruments, Metrichor cloud services
* Streaming, live phylogenetics
